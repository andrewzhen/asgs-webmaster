# A.S. Graphic Studio Webmaster Challenge

## http://asgs-webmaster.firebaseapp.com/

## Description
This is a static, responsive web site hosted using [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) with optimized image files. Built with progressive enhancement in mind, this site is completely usable with JavaScript disabled.

## Get Started for MacOS
1. If you don't already have Node.js installed, click [here](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md).
2. If you already have Node.js installed, proceed to install the Firebase command line interface (CLI) via `npm` by running `npm install -g firebase-tools` as a command in terminal. Follow these [instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions) if it fails.
3. Run `git clone git@github.com:andrewzhen/asgs-webmaster.git` in your desired directory to download this project's files.
4. Head over to the project's base directory (same level as the "public" folder) and run `firebase serve`.
5. Follow the local server URL to see the website!
